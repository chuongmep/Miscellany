## Acknowledgements
The Container Packing nodes build on the C# library [3DContainerPacking](https://github.com/davidmchapman/3DContainerPacking) by [David Chapman](https://github.com/davidmchapman) which in turn is based on the C library [3d-bin-pack](https://github.com/wknechtel/3d-bin-pack/) by [Bill Knechtel](https://github.com/wknechtel) which resurrects a thesis by Ehran Baltacıoğlu at the Air Force Institute of Technology.
